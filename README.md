# WebDevelopmentPortfolio
This site serves as a portfolio for my web development projects. 
My Personal Site was made using HTML5 and CSS. It provides links to my other projects.
The "Tinder for Dogs" website was made using HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap5. 
The "Dice Roll" website was made using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. A new dice roll is displayed when the page is refreshed. 
The "Drumset" website was made using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The site displays 8 images with a picture of a percussive instrument and a letter. Each letter corresponds to a key. If the image is clicked or if the corresponding key is pressed, the image will play a sound.
